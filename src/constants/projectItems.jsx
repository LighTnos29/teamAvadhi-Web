        description: "AgniBaan MK 1 is the first model rocket launched by Team Avadhi. This rocket had an upgraded version of the engine that was tested in Static Test Fire 1. It had a unique composite nozzle designed and developed by the team. It was equipped with a piston ejection-based recovery system, avionics bay, fins, and propulsion system. MK 1 was stimulated in OpenRocket, OpenMotor, and Richard Nakka's Excel Sheet. The rocket weighed around 2.5kgs and was 1.2 metres tall. The MK 1 was launched on 28th August 2023 at 18:15 IST with an apogee of 612 metres. AgniBaan high-powered rocket series is especially focused on the Spaceport America Cup.",

        description: "On 17 June 2023, Team Avadhi designed, fabricated, and tested their first solid rocket motor based on KNSU as the propellant. It generated approx. 180N or 18kgs of thrust. The thrust was measured using a load cell and the data was logged into an SD card and received on a mobile phone in real-time.",

        description: "On 20th December 2023, under Project Astra, a solid rocket motor based on KNSU as propellant was tested. It had an aluminium and fibre-based combustion chamber with an SS nozzle. It generated approx. 677N or 67kgs of thrust. The thrust was measured using a load cell and the data was logged into an SD card and received on a mobile phone in real-time. However, this test did not give the expected results due to upper closure failure.",
